Open Exhibits Solar System Exhibit
=========================

This example shows how to set up a basic project with gestures and accessibility support. 

Coming soon: 

* [History](http://openexhibits.org/#)
* [Tutorial](http://openexhibits.org/#)

For now...

Be sure to set the cml branch to accessibility-dev and the gml branch to development. 

Your project directory should look like the following: 

* C:\repo\open-exhibits-solar-system-exhibit\
* C:\repo\gestureworks-flash-cml\
* C:\repo\gestureworks-flash-gml\

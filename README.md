The Solar System exhibit is a multitouch interface that allows users to select planets as image hotspots and explore the pop-up windows.

Each planet is linked to an informational pop-up that contains a slideshow of images and descriptive text for each planet.

Each pop-up can be rotated, scaled, and dragged. Pop-ups are tethered to the planet for easy identification. The exhibit also includes an attract screen.

The exhibit is fully configured in [CML](http://www.creativeml.org/doku.php) to support customization of a number of features. The exhibit can be customized to support your own subject, content, and style by altering the [CML](http://www.creativeml.org/doku.php) and media files. For example, font sizes and colors, background colors, amount of images, and image navigation buttons are all customizable.
